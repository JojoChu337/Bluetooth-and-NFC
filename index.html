<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
Bluetooth and Near Field Communication (NFC) are two of the most important short-range wireless communication
technologies in modern digital society. They are embedded in almost every smartphone, tablet, laptop and
smart device and enable a wide variety of everyday activities.
</p>

<p>
Although both technologies work wirelessly, they were developed for very different purposes.
Bluetooth is designed for continuous communication over several meters, while NFC focuses on extremely short
distances in order to provide fast and secure interactions.
</p>

<h3>Why These Technologies Matter</h3>
<ul>
<li>They replace physical cables and plastic cards.</li>
<li>They enable contactless payments and smart device control.</li>
<li>They are key components of smart homes, wearables and IoT systems.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Where We Use Them Every Day</h3>

<div class="infobox">
<strong>Key Idea:</strong><br>
Bluetooth is used when devices need to stay connected for a longer time,
NFC is used when a single secure action is enough.

<h2>Bluetooth Technology – In Depth</h2>

<h3>What is Bluetooth?</h3>
<p>
Bluetooth is a short-range wireless communication technology that allows electronic devices to exchange data
without cables. It was originally developed as a replacement for serial cables and has evolved into one of the
most important wireless standards in the world.
</p>

<h3>Main Characteristics</h3>
<table>
<tr><th>Feature</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>Frequency Band</td><td>2.4 GHz ISM Band</td></tr>
<tr><td>Typical Range</td><td>10 – 100 meters</td></tr>
<tr><td>Data Transmission</td><td>Packet-based communication</td></tr>
<tr><td>Power Consumption</td><td>Optimized using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>How Bluetooth Works</h3>
<p>
Bluetooth uses a technique called <strong>frequency hopping spread spectrum</strong>. This means that the signal
changes its frequency many times per second. This reduces interference with Wi-Fi networks and other devices
working in the same frequency band.
</p>

<h3>Pairing Process</h3>
<ol>
<li>One device is put into pairing mode.</li>
<li>The second device scans for available Bluetooth devices.</li>
<li>Both devices exchange security keys.</li>
<li>After successful authentication the devices can communicate securely.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Typical Bluetooth Applications</h3>
<ul>
<li>Wireless headphones and speakers</li>
<li>Smartwatches and fitness trackers</li>
<li>Wireless keyboards, mice and game controllers</li>
<li>Medical sensors and smart home devices</li>
</ul>

<div class="infobox">
<strong>Important:</strong> Bluetooth connections should only be established with trusted devices to avoid
security risks such as unauthorized data access.

<h2>NFC Technology – In Depth</h2>

<h3>What is NFC?</h3>
<p>
NFC stands for <strong>Near Field Communication</strong>. It is a wireless technology that allows devices to exchange
information when they are only a few centimeters apart. This extremely short range is not a limitation, but a
security feature that prevents unwanted connections.
</p>

<h3>Main Characteristics</h3>
<table>
<tr><th>Feature</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>Operating Frequency</td><td>13.56 MHz</td></tr>
<tr><td>Typical Range</td><td>Up to 4 centimeters</td></tr>
<tr><td>Power Usage</td><td>Very low – passive tags possible</td></tr>
<tr><td>Connection Setup</td><td>Instant by touching devices</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>NFC Operating Modes</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reader / Writer Mode:</strong> Smartphones read or write data on NFC tags.</li>
<li><strong>Card Emulation Mode:</strong> The smartphone behaves like a credit card for payments.</li>
<li><strong>Peer-to-Peer Mode:</strong> Two devices exchange small amounts of data.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How NFC Works</h3>
<p>
NFC is based on magnetic field induction. The active device generates an electromagnetic field which powers
passive NFC tags. This is why many NFC cards do not need batteries.
</p>

<h3>Typical NFC Applications</h3>
<ul>
<li>Contactless payments with smartphones or credit cards</li>
<li>Public transport tickets</li>
<li>Hotel room keys and office access cards</li>
<li>NFC tags for automating smartphone actions</li>
</ul>

<div class="infobox">
<strong>Important:</strong> Because NFC works only over a few centimeters, the user always stays in control
of when a connection is established.

<h2>Security and Risks</h2>

<h3>Why Wireless Security is Important</h3>
<p>
Wireless technologies transmit data through the air. This means that information can theoretically be intercepted
by unauthorized persons. Therefore, Bluetooth and NFC include several security mechanisms to protect users.
</p>

<h3>Bluetooth Security Mechanisms</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pairing:</strong> Devices exchange secret keys before communication starts.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Only trusted devices are allowed to connect.</li>
<li><strong>Encryption:</strong> Transmitted data is encrypted to prevent eavesdropping.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Typical Bluetooth Attacks</h3>
<table>
<tr><th>Attack</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>Bluejacking</td><td>Sending unwanted messages to nearby Bluetooth devices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Bluesnarfing</td><td>Stealing data from poorly protected devices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Man-in-the-Middle</td><td>Attacker intercepts the communication.</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>NFC Security Mechanisms</h3>
<ul>
<li>Extremely short operating range.</li>
<li>Secure elements inside smartphones and payment cards.</li>
<li>User confirmation for sensitive actions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Typical NFC Attacks</h3>
<table>
<tr><th>Attack</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>Relay Attack</td><td>Extending the NFC signal to trick systems.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Skimming</td><td>Reading NFC cards without permission.</td></tr>

<div class="infobox">
<strong>Security Tips:</strong><br>
• Disable Bluetooth when not needed.<br>
• Only pair with trusted devices.<br>
• Keep your smartphone locked and updated.

<h2>Bluetooth vs NFC – Detailed Comparison</h2>

<h3>Purpose and Typical Use</h3>
<p>
Bluetooth was created to replace cables and enable continuous wireless communication between devices.
It is ideal for audio streaming, data transfer and connecting peripherals.
NFC was designed for secure and instant interactions over extremely short distances, mainly for payments,
ticketing and access control.
</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Bluetooth</th><th>NFC</th></tr>
<tr><td>Replaces cables</td><td>Replaces cards and tickets</td></tr>
<tr><td>Music, keyboards, IoT devices</td><td>Payments, door access, transport tickets</td></tr>
<tr><td>Connection stays active</td><td>Action is finished in seconds</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Range and Frequency</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bluetooth works up to several meters and uses frequency hopping to avoid interference.</li>
<li>NFC works only a few centimeters and uses a fixed frequency of 13.56 MHz.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Energy Consumption</h3>
<p>
Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) allows devices to run for months on small batteries.
NFC tags often do not need batteries at all, because they are powered by the reader device.
</p>

<h3>Practical Example</h3>
<p>
When you touch your phone to a payment terminal, NFC performs the authentication.
After that, Bluetooth may be used to transfer larger data between devices.
This shows that both technologies are often used together.
